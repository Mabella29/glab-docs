# `glab` Documentation

## ![glab Documentation](/src/assets/glab.png)

GLab is an open source GitLab CLI tool bringing GitLab to your terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code without switching between windows and browser tabs. Work with issues, merge requests, **watch running pipelines directly from your CLI** among other features.
Inspired by [`gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli), the official GitHub CLI tool.

`glab` is available for repositories hosted on GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab Instances. `glab` supports multiple authenticated GitLab instances and automatically detects the authenticated hostname from the remotes available in the working git directory.
