# CONTRIBUTING

Hi there! Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project!

To encourage active collaboration, pull requests are strongly encouraged, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test. I'd also love to hear about ideas for new features as issues.

Please do:

- Check existing issues to verify that the bug or feature request has not already been submitted.
- Open an issue if things aren't working as expected.
- Open an issue to propose a significant change.
- open an issue to propose a feature
- Open a pull request to fix a bug.
- Open a pull request to fix documentation about a command.
- Open a pull request for an issue with the help-wanted label and leave a comment claiming it.
